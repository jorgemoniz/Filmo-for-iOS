It is based on the idea of having this thing... "Filmo", who knows exactly your tastes and recommends a movie suitable for the moment.

And you can carry it everywhere to easily find out the film you want to watch.

It tracks your watchlists, the ones you liked, and you can connect it with Facebook and tell your friends what you've discovered.

Filmo is an mobile application that will be available on the Apple Store & Google Play Store.
It uses machine learning to connect you with people with your same liking.
